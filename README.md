# A Simple Site for Stuff I Listen to
Formatted into 3 sections:
1. Current song on repeat
2. Anime Opening and Ending Themes
3. Other Music

# How to Use
Clone the files and open them in whatever text editor you prefer. 
I personally use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) with the "Live Server" extension as it launches a server and automatically reloads the site every time you save.

Uses HTML 5 and CSS 3, Bootstrap 4.1.1, jQuery 3.3.1, and popper.js 1.14.3.
