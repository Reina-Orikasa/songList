# A Simple Site for Stuff I Listen to

# How to Use
Clone the files and open them in whatever text editor you prefer. 
I personally use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) with the "Live Server" extension as it launches a server and automatically reloads the site every time you save.

Uses Bootstrap 4.1.1, jQuery 3.3.1, and popper.js 1.14.3.
And HTML 5 and CSS 3 of course.
